22,back in 2018 when john oliver did the episode on corporate consolidation it inspired me so much that i applied for a masters of research program got into a program and did my entire research thesis on tech oligopolies it was shocking to see how bad it really is oligopolies that bordered in monopolies are rampant my research essentially focused on the question of whether lack of enforcement of our antitrust laws caused this whole problem or whether lack of adequate laws were the core of the issue the answer was that it was truly both i thoroughly enjoyed my predoctoral masters thesis and am considering a phd in the future its so lovely to see john talk about this specifically on the tech sector edit wow thanks everyone for the great comments i havent published it yet otherwise i would share it with all you lovely people i am now looking for a policy or qualitative researchanalyst job so if anyone is hiring let me know,Misc./Spam

25,hey something that might interest you a couple of days ago my amazon account was closed with no warning for after hours of wasted time theyre telling me its for excessive returns which i think is an error but thats beside the point when they closed my amazon account all my amazon devices that i own for years primarily all my echo devices stopped working i lost access to the amazon photos and prime video which i pay for so apparently the devices you already own are subject to be disabled by amazon on your perceived shopping habits i assume the same applies to all other amazon devices and services like fire os tablets ring cameras and probably aws as well just wanted to make other people aware of this because they definitely dont tell you this when you buy your hardware and services,Misc./Spam
26,points that were missed apple arguably has a specific monopoly in the us with smartphones because of imessage not being open with other multiplatform messaging apps this weirdly only applies in the states the rest of the world favours things like whatsapp and facebook messenger both owned by meta which is its own issue thats probably the main defence apple will bring up theyve been in trouble before but dont forget about microsoft windows 11 has seen them go back to some of their old tricks like a favouring their own software and making it difficult to remove this kind of got glossed over but although google play takes the same cut for purchases as apple you are free to install other app stores and install apps from wherever you like so they avoid the heat there google play is still the most preferred store on android phones so google likely takes advantage of that fact in promoting its own software,Misc./Spam
